# Autonomous-Package-Delivery-Robot
This repository contains the complete Python implementation of an autonomous mail delivery robot, designed as part of a robotics course project.

The project showcases the integration of advanced robotics concepts, including Bayesian Localization and Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control, within the ROS (Robot Operating System) framework.

Key Features:

* Bayesian Localization: Utilizes color-based Bayesian localization to accurately navigate and identify predefined office locations in a simulated environment.
* PID Line Following: Implements a PID controller for precise line following, ensuring the robot stays on course while navigating its route.
* Sensor Integration: Incorporates RGB color and line index sensors for real-time environmental feedback and decision-making.
* Package Delivery Simulation: Executes a task-specific behavior for simulating package delivery to designated offices, including precise movements and turns.
* Robust Control Mechanisms: Features additional control functionalities like straight-line movement correction and sharp turn detection for enhanced maneuverability.
